The world is like morphine. Little indulgence is good and necessary, but too much is harmful! Pleasures of life are essential for us, they bring peace, happiness, joy and healing. They are blessings from God! But on the other hand, the bible also warns us of these temporal pleasures.

An example of the principle would be; enjoying the pleasure of some delicious food. But too much of its indulgence results in bad health.

It is very important for a Christian to have the right perspective on this subject. As 1 Cor 7:31 states we should use the world, but not abuse it in order to satisfy our lusts. 

> 1 Corinthians 7:31 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.

> NET 1 Corinthians 7:31 those who use the world as though they were not using it to the full. For the present shape of this world is passing away.

**There is something more important than pleasure of this life.**

For those who don’t know God, seeking pleasure, comfort and security is their goal. They labour and do all they can, so that at the end of they day they would gather the resources to enjoy the pleasures of this world. Although this is a blessing from God, it is not the final and ultimate purpose of man.

> 1 John 2:17 And the world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God abides forever.

Doing the will of God is the greater purpose, not chasing after the lusts of this world. Christians need to have this priority straight. Else, they would find themselves in sin, and not in right relation with God.

**Control your appetites** 

> NBJ 1 Thessalonians 4:4 and each one of you to know how to control his body in a way that is holy and honourable, 5 not giving way to selfish lust like the nations who do not acknowledge God.

Self-control, restrain, discipline and temperance are the tools through which we can keep our appetites in check. We don’t naturally have these qualities but can cultivate it through knowledge and practice.

Knowledge makes us aware of the consequences of our actions. Meditating on the consequences of our behaviour gives us the power to deny pleasures which will harm us in future. Pleasure of sin is for a season, then comes the wages of sin which is death.

**Applying this knowledge at the time of temptations is how we overcome sin.** When Jesus was tempted, he applied his knowledge of the scriptures. What if he did not have the knowledge? Would he be equipped to face the challenges of the devil?
Let us be like Jesus! Use the world but never abuse it!
