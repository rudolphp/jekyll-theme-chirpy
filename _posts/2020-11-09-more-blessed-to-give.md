**It is more blessed to give than to receive.**

>Acts 20:35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, **It is more blessed to give than to receive.
We feel blessed when we receive something. This is the right response. But have you ever felt blessed by giving to others? If not; then you should try. It is a blessing to see other happy because of your generosity. 

The key word in this verse is “more”. Yes, it is a blessing to receive gifts; but is it MORE of a blessing to give!

**Jesus is our example**

>Mark 10:45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

As a king, Jesus chooses to focus on giving, rather than receiving. He did the ultimate sacrifice, gave his own life for the sake of others. He was the strong who supported the weak. In the world, mostly, the weak serve the strong. Christians are encouraged to be strong, so that they can turn around and help their weak brothers to become strong.

Paul followed in the footsteps of his master. He planted many churches but refrained from living on support from them. He chose instead to work for his own needs and then work some more for the needs of others. He did this also to be an example to others. 

As Christians we should do our best to not be a burden on the church. Sure, there will be rare occasions when we will need the help of fellow Christians. But “a taker” this should not be our testimony. We should strive to be "a giver". The irony is that in the end it is the givers that turn out to be the “more blessed”!!
