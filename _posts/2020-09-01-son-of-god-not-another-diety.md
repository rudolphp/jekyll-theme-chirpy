In the bible, the Son of God is God’s human son Jesus. The title “Son of God” has confused many. Confusion and contradiction will result, if this title is taken literally. 

In the literal sense, sons are pro created by their fathers. But we need to remember that Pro-creation is only for creatures and not the creator! God cannot and does not pro create. Therefore, this term is not to be taken literally, when the creator God is in context.

The other similar term, “Son of Man” can be taken literally. A son of man is another man. Having all the nature and attributes of a man. The same cannot be true of a Son of God. A Son of God, does not and cannot have all the nature and attribute of God.

In the bible the term “Son of God” is a title given to creatures who have a special position and relation with God. They have authority and dominion in God's kingdom. It is mostly given to Jesus. But there are a few others who are called by this title. The angels, Israel and Adam were also called Sons!

It’s first occurrence in gospels, is in Matthew 4, when Satan temps Jesus to prove if he is the Son of God. This temptation attempt by Satan would not make sense if Jesus was deity. This is exactly how Satan tempted Adam in the garden, another son of God. Temptations has always been the experience of humans. God cannot be tempted!

>NLT John 1:49 Nathanael replied, "Teacher, you are **the Son of God-- the King of Israel!**"

John 1:49 defines “Son of God”. It means he is the King of Israel. Israel’s kings were appointed differently than other nations. They were specifically chosen by God. God choose David as the first king and promised him that only his sons will be the future kings of Israel. 

>2 Samuel 7:12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 14 **I will be his father, and he shall be my son**...

A man proceeding out from David, therefore cannot literally exist before David. Although, we can say that this son existed in the mind and plan of God! This is similar to how the Lamb was slain before the foundation of the world in Rev. 13:8. The Lamb obviously was not there at the foundation of the world. But we can truly say, God planned the Lamb to be slain since the foundation of the world.

>Luke 1:31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the **Son of the Highest**: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of **his kingdom there shall be no end**.

In conclusion, consider the first mention in Luke’s gospel, the title “Son of the Highest”! signifies being God’s King! The promised son of David whose kingdom will have no end! This title has nothing to do with being another deity with divine nature, but everything to do with God’s human king!
