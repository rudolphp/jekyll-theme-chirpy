>Psalm 6:4 Turn, O Lord, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love. 5 For **in death there is no remembrance of you**; in Sheol [grave] who will give you praise?

This is a great prayer of David. He is asking God to spare his life. For If he dies, he will no longer be able to praise HIM. Though David was saved by God miraculously several times. There came a day when he died. Peter says this about David:

>Acts 2:29 Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both **died** and was **buried**, and his **tomb** is with us to this day.

David like all the other faithful saints, died and is still in the grave. Waiting for the day of resurrection. No, he is not alive in heaven praising God.

Death is the cessation of life. It is not a change or transformation into some other form of existence. At death you cease to exists! As harsh and depressing as this maybe, it is the truth.

**Satan’s lie – You will not surely die.**
>Genesis 3:4 But the serpent said to the woman, You will not surely die.

This lie that Eve was convinced off is still believed by many. That death is not really a threat. Some even look at death as a promotion into some better life. Nothing can be further from the truth.

Death has always been man’s greatest enemy. An enemy that always wins! No man has escaped death. Resurrection is the only escape from death. Other than the resurrection we have no hope of conquering death.

**What is death? – Death is a return.**
>Genesis 3:19 By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.

>Psalm 104:29 When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.

>Ecclesiastes 3:20 All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return.

These verses define death for us. Death is a return back to where we were taken from - dust. At death God takes the breath of life out from us and we become dust.

The good news is that though we die, God does not forget us. Just as Jesus was raised from the death, never to die again. We too have the promise of eternal life, if we remain faithful!
