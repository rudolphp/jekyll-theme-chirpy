Christians are called “People of the Book”. The scriptures (Old & New Testament) are the foundations of Christian faith and practise. We are not supposed to lean on our own understanding, culture and teachers; but to first objectively look to the scriptures for all guidance.

**Scripture is not by the will of Man**

>2 Peter 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

2 Peter 1:21 explains how we got our bible. It did not fall from the sky. It is not a word for word dictation from God. Neither is it all sourced in man. 

Man did not come-up with these writings. It is a combination and alliance between both God and man. Holy devout men, received revelation from God. God spoke to the Prophets (Heb. 1.1). The prophets or their contemporaries then penned the revelation for generations to come. 

**God => Prophets (holy men) => Our forefathers => Us**

**ALL Scripture**

>1 Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works 

In 1 Timothy 3:16 the word “All” is important. For the Jews all scripture is from Genesis to Malachi. For the Mormons, it is the bible plus the book of Mormon’s. Then for the Catholics it’s the apocryphal books as well. For the non-Catholics, it’s the 66 books only.

“All” Scripture, or the canon was decided by our forefathers. As we see in the chain from God to Us. Between the prophets and us are the “forefathers”. Depending on which group of “forefathers” we are influenced by, will sway and decide what canon of scriptures we will accept. Our teachers are also like our forefathers, they are instrumental in handing us down the scriptures.

After we have received the faith from our teachers, it is then our responsibility to search the scriptures daily and be changed by the truth ourselves. We should read the scriptures carefully and interpret it ourselves. Sure, there is a need for help from teachers, but our teachers can be wrong and deceived.

**Get the hermeneutics right.**

The safe and best hermeneutic principle is to first look at the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels. The Gospels is the foundation. His apostles like Peter and Paul then build on Jesus’ teaching in the gospels. There is nothing they teach which was not grounded and based on what Jesus had already taught in the gospels. 

If you come across a teaching, which is not based on Jesus’ teachings in the first 4 books of the New testament, it should trigger red flags in your mind. Ask the question, where is this in the gospels? If its not there it is not true. Sure, the later books elaborate and teach us very important things, but these should be sourced from the gospels. The root cause of every Christian doctrine, should be found in the teachings of the Christ!
