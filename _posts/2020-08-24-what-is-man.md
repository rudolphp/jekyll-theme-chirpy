In Psalm 8:3-4, David is praising God for His creation. He realizes how insignificant man is, not deserving the attention of the Almighty God who created the heavens and all that is in it. A synonym for man is the phrase "Son of man". This title is the most common way Jesus referred to himself. Jesus was a "Son of man". Signifying and emphasizing that he was a man!

> Psalm 8:3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 4 **What is man**, that thou art mindful of him? and the **son of man**, that thou visitest him? 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 6 **Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands**; thou hast put all things under his feet: 7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.

In verse 5, Man is lower than the angels, (So was Jesus. Jesus was not an angel) **Yet** man still has his own glory and honour. **Man has glory, because God has given him dominion over all that He has created.**

**_Man's purpose is to be God's viceroy! A ruler, exercising authority on behalf of sovereign God. Man was made to be God's heir, thus His "Son"._** 

Man is destined to become "Son of God". But he has to qualify and prove himself worthy. Since Adam's fall, Jesus is the first man who has qualified and attained this position. This is good news! as it gives all others hope to continue in faithfulness until the end and enter into the blessing as joint heirs with Jesus.
