Psalm 8:3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
 6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
 7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
 9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!


Psalm 100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
 2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
 3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
 4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
 5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
