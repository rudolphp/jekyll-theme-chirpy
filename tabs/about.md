Hello! Welcome to my blog. 

My name is Rudy Pereira and I live in Colva, Goa with my wife and 5 children.

I am a software engineer by trade but Theology is my first love. I was introduced to the bible 25 years ago. A relative invited me to an evangelical service. The first sermon I heard moved me deeply. The preacher passionately explained how God in his great wisdom has created all things we see. If I remember correctly, I had goosebumps :) Since this personal experience, I have done my best to stay faithful and obedient to the truths of the scriptures.

The purpose of this journal is first, so I would keep myself encouraged in the faith. Secondly, to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom of God. 

Thank you for stopping by!
