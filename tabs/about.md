Hello! Welcome to my blog. 

My name is Rudy Pereira and I live in Colva, Goa with my wife and 5 children.
I am a software engineer by profession, with a keen interest in Theology, Philosophy and History. 

I became a christian 25 years ago.

The purpose of this journal, is first, so I would keep myself encouraged in the faith. Secondly, to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom of God.

Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or inputs.

Thank you for stopping by!
