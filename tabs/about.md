Hello! Welcome to my blog. 

My name is Rudy Pereira and I live in Goa, India with my wife and 5 children.
I am a software engineer by profession, with a keen interest in Theology, Philosophy and History. 

The purpose of this journal, is first to keep myself encouraged in the faith. Secondly, to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom of God.

Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or inputs.

Thank you for stopping by!
