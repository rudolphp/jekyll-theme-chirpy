Though one has no control of this event, it has had the most profound effect on our personhood. It determined our parents and the culture and environment that would affect everything about us. For this reason, a thorough study of the nativity of Jesus is crucial to understand the rest of the gospels. Scriptures do give us detailed information regarding this event.</p><blockquote><p>Luke 1:26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.</p></blockquote><p><strong>God triggered the events</strong></p><p>It is important to note, that it was not man who decided Jesus’ birth. It was God, Who in his perfect plan triggered these events into motion.</p><p>The story begins with God, sending angel Gabriel to commission Mary and Joseph; two godly Jews and descendants’ of David, the kingly lineage. In this article, we focus on Mary. The role she played and how she perceived and understood things.<br /> Mary understandably is going to play a major role. In Catholicism Mary is deified, which obviously is not true, but yet she is a very important person in the gospel story.</p><p>God waited until Mary was engaged. He wanted to obviously hide her conception as a virgin, So he picked an engaged couple. Virgin birth was a sign (Isa 7:14; Isa 9:1-7) that the child is the promised son, that he is the Son of God!</p><blockquote><p>Luke 1:30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Mary is commissioned</strong></p><p>In verse 31 Mary was told that she will become pregnant with a baby boy! – This would be a supernatural conception, that there would be no man involved. Other than this, the angel did not tell about a spirit-being transforming into a human embryo inside Mary. There is no hint of incarnation! The idea of pregnancy is always around a male and a female coming together to conceive a child. This same context is around the birth of Jesus. Mary would name this boy JESUS signifying a beginning of new life. If this person was a pre-existing person it would make no sense that he be named somewhere in the middle of his life.</p><p>In verse 32 The angel goes on to explain why God is doing this miracle. It was to fulfil His promise of giving Israel and the nations His Messiah, the Christ! This son will not be an ordinary person, but the Son of God. Mary as a jew understood this prophesy.</p><blockquote><p>34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore, also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Mary questions – How will this thing be??</strong></p><p>In verse 34 Mary asks for clarification. Her question is clear. She needs to know in detail, how she will become pregnant. If Incarnation is true, this would be the time and place for the angel to explain something like this “Look, the pre-existing, eternally begotten Son is going to become a human inside of you”. On hearing this Mary would have freaked out 😊. This is just a joke. But really, think about it. The angel said nothing like that. In fact, he stated the true facts exactly like it was. He told her clearly and plainly. A straight honest question was asked, and a straight honest answer was given.</p><p>Secondly, think about it, Mary has the right to know all the details. If there is anyone in the world who should know the details, it would be Mary. And she was not told about the Incarnation, Why? Because it is not true! Incarnation is not true! I had brought this point up to a teacher who believes in Incarnation. My point was we need to ask the question “How did Mary understood this revelation given to her by the angel”. The teacher replied “Mary was not told everything, since revelation is progressive.” If one reads this passage carefully, she was in fact told everything. She would become pregnant through the power of God. This is not how women get pregnant normally. It was clear, that she does not need a man in this case. She will conceive supernaturally by the power of Holy Spirit. The reason being, this was the Christ! The Son of God!</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/christology/'>Christology</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/birth-of-jesus/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >birth of jesus</a> <a href="/tags/incarnation/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >incarnation</a> <a href="/tags/pre-existence/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >pre-existence</a> <a href="/tags/humanity-of-jesus/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >humanity of jesus</a> <a href="/tags/nature-of-jesus/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >nature of jesus</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><!-- Post sharing snippet v2.1 https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy © 2019 Cotes Chung Published under the MIT License --><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Birth of Jesus; as understood by Mary - TheEternal.life&url=https://theeternal.life/posts/birth-of-jesus/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Birth of Jesus; as understood by Mary - TheEternal.life&u=https://theeternal.life/posts/birth-of-jesus/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=Birth of Jesus; as understood by Mary - TheEternal.life&url=https://theeternal.life/posts/birth-of-jesus/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" onclick="copyLink()" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link"></i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><!-- The Pannel on right side (Desktop views) v2.0 https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy © 2017-2019 Cotes Chung MIT License --><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><h3 data-toc-skip>Recent Update</h3><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/what-is-man/">What is Man?</a></li></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><h3 data-toc-skip>Trending Tags</h3><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/son-of-man/">son of man</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/son-of-god/">son of god</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/pre-existence/">pre existence</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/nature-of-jesus/">nature of jesus</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/incarnation/">incarnation</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/humanity-of-jesus/">humanity of jesus</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/resurrection/">resurrection</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/purpose-of-life/">purpose of life</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/death/">death</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/birth-of-jesus/">birth of jesus</a></div></div></div><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><h3 data-toc-skip class="pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</h3><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"> <!-- Recommend the other 3 posts according to the tags and categories of the current post, if the number is not enough, use the other latest posts to supplement. v2.0 https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy © 2019 Cotes Chung Published under the MIT License --><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/son-of-god-not-another-diety/"><div class="card-body"> <!-- Date format snippet v2.4.1 https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy © 2020 Cotes Chung MIT License --> <span class="timeago small" > Sep 1 <i class="unloaded">2020-09-01T00:00:00+05:30</i> </span><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>The Son of God, is NOT another deity</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> In the bible, the Son of God is God’s human son Jesus.
